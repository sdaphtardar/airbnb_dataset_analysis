    "Based on the data available objective of this analysis is going to be to discover factors behind several situations; e.g. which neighborhoods are always overbooked? what exactly causes that? is it because of the surrounding area or the rental facilities are very good? knowledge about these things can tell Airbnb how they can approach the situation. Maybe the listings are not very good, or the service provided is not upto the mark. whatever the reason understanding what are the environmental factors is the first step towards the improvement."
